# GifTastic
Cartoon Gifs
This project was created for UNC CH Coding bootcamp. It is a simple page that pulls the top 10 results from thy giphy api for a user input selection

Getting Started:
Click one of the buttons present or input your selection for a new button to appear. Once you click a button your gifs will show in a paused state. Click the gif to have them play, click them again to turn them back to still images.

Built With:
Jquery 
Javascript - Javascript
BootStrap

Current Problems:
Input field does not automatically clear out causing user to have to delete prior input. No limits exist on preventing the same input from having multiple buttons.
